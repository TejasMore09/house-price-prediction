# house-price-prediction
In this project, I built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features provided in the dataset. The dataset contains 545 entries and 13 columns, including attributes such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of stories, and several categorical features. The main objective of this task was to develop an understanding of regression modeling, evaluation metrics, and model interpretation.
I first loaded the dataset into a pandas df and performed basic preprocessing. Since the dataset included both numerical and categorical features, I applied label encoding to the categorical variables so that they could be handled properly by the machine learning model.
After preprocessing, I selected the relevant features for the model. I split the dataset into training and testing sets, using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. I then trained a Linear Regression model from sklearn.linear_model on the training data. Once the model was trained, I made predictions on the test set.
To evaluate the performance of the model, I calculated key evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the RÂ² score. I also created a scatter plot to visualize the actual versus predicted house prices. Since multiple input features were involved, I plotted the comparison between actual and predicted prices instead of plotting against a single feature like area. I have included the necessary files for this project submission, which are the dataset (Housing.csv), the Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code (House Price Prediction.ipynb), and this README.md file summarizing the process and findings.
